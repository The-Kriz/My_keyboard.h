# My_keyboard.h
After trying mechanical keyboard for the first time,
I liked it more than the membrane keyboard is used for all these years but they are cheap when compared to mechanical keyboard,
so i thought of making a Diy version of it which will be cheap and i can make it according to my liking and my budget 
and i can learn more about it and customize to a myown version.
so i started my research on it and started to do programming for macro key using arduino Pro micro and kryboard.h library
